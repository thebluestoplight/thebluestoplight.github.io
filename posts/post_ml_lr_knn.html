            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>While making my lyrics generator project I figured that I should've probably started with programs that are easier to understand. I had next to no prior experience with AI programming, so it still can be problematic for me to follow along such guides.</p>
            <p>This time I expermineted with the fundamental algorithms of ML - Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours.</p>

            <h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
            <p>For this process I based my projects off of <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNine">NeuralNine's</a></u> tutorials. He made great videos of explaining the maths behind these functions while providing example code written in Python. For in depth explanations please check the channel out.</p>
            <p>I used two datasets from Kaggle for the two algorithms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/song-popularity-dataset">Song Popularity Dataset</a></u></li>
                <li><u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amansaxena/lifeexpectancy">Life Expectancy of the World</a></u></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the second one (used for KNN), I basically just grabbed some numbers from the dataset, and also tried using some randomization because, for now, I just wanted to test, and figure out my functions, so the results <b>will be</b> nonsensical.</p>

            <h2 id="lr">Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>For Linear Regression I took the "song_popularity" and the "speechiness" columns of the Song Popularity Dataset and set them as my axis. This is what this data alone looks like on a coordinate system:</p>

            </div>

            <p>After that I followed the tutorial and wrote the appropriate code to calculate the function.</p>
            <p>The main loop for calculating <i>m</i> and <i>b</i>:</p>
            
            <pre>
                <code>
    m = 0
    b = 0
    learning_rate = 0.0001
    epochs = 150
    
    for i in range(epochs):
        m, b = gradient_descent(m, b, data, learning_rate)
        
        print(f"[Current Iteration Number]: {i}")
        # print(f"[Current Loss]: {loss(m, b, data)}")
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>These settings led to the following results:</p>

            <div class="article-img">
                <img src="../res/ml01.png">
            </div>

            <h2 id="knn">K-Nearest Neightbours</h2>
            <p>The KNN was trickier. As I earlier said, I just took the int values of the ages from the dataset, and set them as coordinates. I tried randomizing them at first, but later I switched to other fixed values from the dataset.</p>
            <p>This program took a bit more time to complete, since I had to implement a way of using a CSV dataset instead of the dictionary handwritten in the tutorial. Let me show you some of my snippets:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
    # Import

    data = pan.read_csv('datasets/life.csv', encoding="ISO-8859-1", usecols=['overall', 'male', 'female'])
    points = data.to_dict()
    
    # Predict (inside of the KNN class)
    
    def predict(self, n_point):
            distances = []
    
            for category in self.points:
                for i, point in enumerate(self.points[category]):
                    if (category == 'male'):
                        distance = eculidean_distance([point, -points['overall'][i]], n_point)
                    else:
                        distance = eculidean_distance([point, points['overall'][i]], n_point)
                    distances.append([distance, category])
    
            categories = [category[1] for category in sorted(distances)[:self.k]]
            result = Counter(categories).most_common(1)[0][0]
    
            return result
    
    # Visualization
    
    for i, point in enumerate(points['male']):
        ax.scatter(point, -points['overall'][i], color="#1E8AA9", s=60)
        
    for i, point in enumerate(points['female']):
        ax.scatter(point, points["overall"][i], color="#9271D9", s=60)
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>As you can see the coordinates are all just made up, they do **not** represent any valuable information. Next time I'll make sure to choose a dataset that I can use at my level. I'm sure I could've made it work somehow with my code, but I just couldn't think outside of the box.</p>
            <p>Here are my result with two sample testing points:</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I think this was a great way to practice, and introduce myself to the most basic concepts. I'm looking forward to continue this journey, and learn more about more advanced topics of ML.</p>
